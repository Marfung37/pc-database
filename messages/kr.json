  "about_pc": "A Perfect Clear (PC) is the action of returning back to the empty board state in Tetris. The method usually consists of a setup and a solve to complete a 4x10 box. Due to Tetris rules – 7bag, 10 wide board, and hold – there turns out to be distinct PC numbers that eventually loop. These are mainly differentiated due to the 7-bag structure that is cut off at each 10 pieces used for a PC, which pieces in the 7-bag after the cut off is called the \"leftover\" for the following PC. From holding a piece between PCs, which is called saving, one can affect the next PC’s leftover, which is important as it affects the chance of completing a PC and chance of saving a piece for subsequent PCs.",
  "about_pc_num": "There are 7 distinct leftover lengths depicted in the table below along with the PC number they correspond with. The terms \"8th\" and \"9th\" describe that some 7-piece and 4-piece leftovers, respectively, are possible over 1st and 2nd. A setup is categorized by the PC number and leftover it is built on. The order of the pieces can differentiate which setup is possible, and the setups are usually ordered by how \"good\" a setup is by solve and save chance." ,
