Due to Tetris rules, 7bag; 10 wide board; and hold, there turns out be distinct \"PC's\" that eventually loop. These are mainly differentated due to the 7bag structure that is cut off at each 10 pieces used for a PC, which pieces in the 7bag leftover after the cut off is call the \"leftover\" for the following PC. From holding a piece between PC's, which is called saving, one can affect the next PC's leftover, which is important as it affects the chance of completing a PC and chance of saving a piece for subsequent PC.",
